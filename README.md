# Restaurant-Recommendation-System

Restaurant Recommendation System (RRS) is a type of recommender system that uses content- based filtering. This method only uses information about the description and attributes of items that users have previously consumed to model user preferences. By this we mean that in our system, unlike other systems used in food delivery apps such as Zomato and Swiggy, instead of the food being recommended first by the distance of the restaurant from your location, we shall be recommending restaurants to visit based on the reviews received by those restaurants by other customers as well. These restaurants will be given priority on the basis of the user’s previous orders and preferences. We shall create a content-based recommendation system where when the user enters the name of a restaurant, the RRS will look at reviews from other restaurants, and will recommend them to other restaurants with similar reviews and sort them from the top-rated in a descending order.
